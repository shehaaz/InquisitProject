<big style="font-family: Verdana;">However, there are some rules you
need to follow to complete the task:<br>
</big>
<ul>

  <li><big style="font-family: Verdana;">You can only move one ball at
a time. </big></li>
  <li><big style="font-family: Verdana;">You are not allowed to pick up
more than one ball at any time. </big></li>
  <li><big style="font-family: Verdana;">You cannot place balls
anywhere else other than the three pegs. </big></li>
  <li><big style="font-family: Verdana;">You can only place
<%values.n_a_slots%>&nbsp;balls on the left peg,
<%values.n_b_slots%>&nbsp;on the middle peg, and
<%values.n_c_slots%>&nbsp;on the right peg. </big></li>
  <li><big style="font-family: Verdana;">Finally, you need to make the
new pattern in a special number of moves.</big></li>
</ul>

<big style="font-family: Verdana;">The allowed number of moves for each
pattern will be displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. If you preform too many moves, the task will reset and you will get one other try. 
 <br>
 To pick up one of the balls, click on it with the mouse. Move the ball to
a peg with at least one free spot on it and click again to release it.<br>
